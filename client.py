Notes
==============

socket.gethostname() gets the current machines hostname, for example "DESKTOP-1337PBJ"

string.encode('UTF-8') encodes the given string into a 'bytes' literal object using the utf-8 standard that is required
bytes.decode("utf-8") decodes some 'bytes' literal object using the utf-8 standard that information gets sent over the internet in

all the b'string here' are converting a string into binary format. Hence the B
